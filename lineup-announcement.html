    <h1>📢 Lineup Announcement Rules – CPL 3.0</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1️⃣ When to Announce</h2>
      <p>Captains must announce the full lineup (both halves) before the match starts.</p>
      <p>Keeps things transparent & avoids mid-match reshuffling. ✅</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2️⃣ Player Reporting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First half players:</strong> must be present at match start.</li>
        <li><strong>Second half players:</strong> must report within 45 mins of start time.</li>
        <li>Standard late penalties apply ⏱️</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3️⃣ Format to Announce (examples)</h2>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
      <pre>
S1 – Name1  
S2 – Name2  
D1 – Name3 / Name4 (EP)  
D2 – Name5 / Name6  
S3 – Name7  
S4 – Name8  
D3 – Name9 / Name10  
D4 – Name11 / Name12 (EP)
      </pre>
      <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
      <pre>
S1 / S3 – Name1  
S2 – Name2  
D1 / D3 – Name3 / Name4 (EP)  
D2 / D4 – Name5 / Name6

      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4️⃣ Same Player Playing Reverse Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If <strong>S1</strong> plays reverse too as S3, he will play <strong>S3</strong>of the oppoenent.</li>
        <li>If <strong>S2</strong> plays reverse too as S4, he will play <strong>S4</strong>of the oppoenent.</li>
        <li>Same applies to <strong>D1, D2</strong> while playing reverse</li>
        <li>If both teams are playing the same players in 2nd half. They just exchange opponents as we did in season2</li>
        <li>Simple rule to remember : 2 nd half if same player plays he shouldn't play the same oppoenet</li>
        <li>No mixing singles and doubles players</li>
        <li>No splitting of doubles pairs. Second half you want different players, both should be different</li>
      </ul>
